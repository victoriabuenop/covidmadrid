# covidmadrid
Created in January 2021
Twitter Bot that publishes weekly COVID-19 data obtained from Madrid City Hall sensors.

Bot that I created to learn more about how to use Twitter API and pandas library on Python.
It reads data from Madrid Datos Abiertos opendata files to display it on Twitter after analizing and converting it to mean values and graphs.
In this personal project I also learned how to use AWS to run my code and have it running 24/7.
Rightnow the code is not running, bot is dead.
