Created in January 2021
Twitter Bot that publishes weekly COVID-19 data obtained from Madrid City Hall data.

Bot that I created to learn more about how to use Twitter API and pandas library on Python.
It reads data from Madrid Datos Abiertos opendata files to display it on Twitter after analyzing and converting it to mean values and graphs
Rightnow the code is not running, bot is dead.
